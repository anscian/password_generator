# Password Generator using python

This is my first github project where I have build a basic password generator.

The program when run would take in some arguments and give the password that it generates using the input
If the program is run in terminal with 2 arguments, first symbolizing the string from which characters are taken and second to give the length of the password.
It raises an error for invalid number of arguments
